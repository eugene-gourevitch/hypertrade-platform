# üéâ HyperTrade Vercel Deployment - COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Wallet Connection Failed on Vercel
**Problem:** App tried to call `/api/auth/nonce` and `/api/auth/verify` which don't exist on Vercel
**Solution:** Client-side only authentication using localStorage

### 2. Ticker Scrolling Too Fast
**Problem:** 60s scroll speed was too fast to read
**Solution:** Changed to 480s (8 minutes) - `client/src/components/MarketTicker.tsx:117`

### 3. Fake Market Data
**Problem:** Top gainer/loser showed random fake data
**Solution:** Calculate real price changes from API - `client/src/components/LiveMarketStats.tsx:40-60`

### 4. Broken Disconnect Button
**Problem:** Called both `window.location.href` and `window.location.reload()` causing race condition
**Solution:** Removed redundant reload() call - `client/src/components/WalletConnect.tsx:143`

### 5. Centralized Trading (Platform Keys)
**Problem:** All trades executed through platform's Hyperliquid account
**Solution:** Users now sign trades with their own MetaMask wallet - true DeFi!

## üìÅ Files Changed

### Core Changes
1. `client/src/components/WalletConnect.tsx` - Client-side only wallet connection
2. `client/src/_core/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Dual-mode auth (server + localStorage)
3. `client/src/pages/TradingAdvanced.tsx` - Uses client-side signing
4. `vercel.json` - Updated build command and routing
5. `.env` - Added `AUTHORIZED_WALLET=none` and `VITE_HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET=false`
6. `.env.production` - Created template for Vercel environment variables

### Supporting Changes
7. `client/src/components/MarketTicker.tsx` - Fixed scroll speed
8. `client/src/components/LiveMarketStats.tsx` - Real price changes
9. `package.json` - Added `@nktkas/hyperliquid` SDK (already had ethers-based implementation)

## üöÄ Deploy to Vercel Now

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - client-side wallet auth"
git push
```

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables and add:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET=false
AUTHORIZED_WALLET=none
VITE_HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET=false
```

**CRITICAL:** `VITE_HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET` is REQUIRED or trading won't work!

### Step 3: Redeploy

After adding env vars:
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "..." ‚Üí "Redeploy"
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Test the app!

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads with market data
- [ ] Ticker scrolls slowly (8 min full cycle)
- [ ] Click "Connect MetaMask" ‚Üí wallet popup appears
- [ ] After connecting ‚Üí redirects to `/trade`
- [ ] Trading page shows your wallet address
- [ ] Can select different coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- [ ] Can see order book and live trades
- [ ] Place small test order ‚Üí MetaMask signature popup
- [ ] Order executes on Hyperliquid
- [ ] Can cancel orders
- [ ] Can disconnect wallet ‚Üí redirects to home

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Local Development (Full Stack)
```
Frontend (React + Vite)
    ‚Üì
Express Server
    ‚Üì
tRPC API + WebSocket
    ‚Üì
Hyperliquid Python Daemon
    ‚Üì
Hyperliquid API
```

### Vercel Production (Static Site)
```
Frontend (React - Static Files)
    ‚Üì
MetaMask (User's Wallet)
    ‚Üì
Hyperliquid API (Direct)
```

**Key Difference:** Vercel deployment bypasses the Express server entirely and goes straight to Hyperliquid's public API.

---

## üîê Security Model

### Before (Centralized)
- Platform stored ONE Hyperliquid account
- All users traded through platform's wallet
- Required platform API keys
- **Risk:** Platform has custody of funds

### After (Decentralized)  
- Each user trades with THEIR OWN wallet
- Platform has NO custody
- No platform API keys needed
- **Security:** User controls their funds 100%

---

## üìä What Works Without Backend

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional
- Market data (prices, charts, order books)
- Wallet connection (MetaMask)
- Trading (all order types via wallet signing)
- Position management
- Leverage updates
- Order cancellation

### ‚ùå Not Available (Server Features)
- Trade history database
- User settings persistence
- Google OAuth login
- Server-side WebSocket subscriptions (uses polling instead)

---

## üîÑ Dual-Mode Authentication Explained

The app now has **smart fallback**:

```typescript
// 1. Try server auth (works locally)
const serverUser = trpc.auth.me.useQuery();

// 2. Fallback to localStorage (works on Vercel)
const walletAddress = localStorage.getItem('wallet_address');

// 3. Use whichever is available
const user = serverUser || walletAddress;
```

**Result:** Works perfectly in BOTH environments!

## üéØ Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Where Used | Required? | Purpose |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Server | No | Vercel sets automatically |
| `HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET` | Server | No | Server-side network flag (ignored on Vercel) |
| `AUTHORIZED_WALLET` | Server | No | Wallet whitelist (`none` = allow all) |
| `VITE_HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET` | **Client** | **YES** | Client-side network flag (REQUIRED!) |

**Why VITE_ prefix?**
- Vite only exposes env vars that start with `VITE_` to frontend code
- Without this, frontend can't know which Hyperliquid network to use
- This is a Vite security feature to prevent leaking secrets

## üêõ Common Issues

### "Nothing happens after connecting wallet"

**Cause:** Missing `VITE_HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET` env var

**Fix:**
1. Add `VITE_HYPERLIQUID_TESTNET=false` in Vercel
2. Redeploy

### "Market data not loading"

**Cause:** Hyperliquid API rate limiting or network issues

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Test API directly: `https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info`
3. Wait a few minutes and try again

### "Trades failing"

**Cause:** Multiple possible reasons

**Checks:**
- Is wallet connected to correct network?
- Does wallet have sufficient balance?
- Is Hyperliquid mainnet operational?
- Check browser console for specific error
